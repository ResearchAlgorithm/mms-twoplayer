USAGE: ./mms.o [options]

-m <p>	A parameter <p> should be provided after "-m". Set the number of goods as p.
	If -m is not provided, the program use the default value 50.

-e <e>	A parameter <e> should be provided after "-m". Set the error of the solution as e.
	e should be a float number in (0,1).
	If -m is not provided, the program will compute the solution with error [0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 0.03 0.02 0.01].

-f <f>	A file name <f> should be provided after "-f". Read problem from file <f> in stanard format.
	The file contains 3 lines of data.
	Line 1: an integer m denoting the number of goods and an integer MMS1 denoting the MMS of player 1.
	Line 2: m integers. ith number denotes the value of ith goods of player1.
	Line 3: m integers. ith number denotes the value of ith goods of player2.
	If -f is not provided, the program will randomly generate the value of goods with mean 5000 and standard deviation 500.
-r <r>	Repeate r times, each time compute an instance. Note that in this case, the data can only randomly generated rather than reading from file.
-v	No verbose
